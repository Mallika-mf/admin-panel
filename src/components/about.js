                            <p>How often does your mom say ‘Don’t eat outside food’? Though we used to stroll her words, now it seems to be the best option. Isn’t it? But we all are habituated to ready-made food delivered by the time we reach. Then let us ask you some questions. Have you ever seen their kitchen? Do they maintain hygiene? Do they have fresh supplies of vegetables and groceries? We’re sure you don’t have an answer for this. Now let us say something about MothersFood and the values that we follow religiously:</p>

                    For all those who say these things to your mother, have you
                    ever given thought to what your mom wanted to become when
                    she was young? Despite anything, she settled down to take
                    care of your family without any complaint. Now the question
                    is if you are given a chance, will you be willing to provide
                    them with the identity that they always wanted? If yes,
                    MothersFood is your answer. <br />
                    <br />
                    If you ever stayed away from home, you might understand the
                    value of Home food. Are we wrong? You might have spent days
                    wishing for those excellent delicacies but went to sleep
                    with disappointment with something that you had at a
                    restaurant that is nowhere close to satisfy your tastebuds.
                    MothersFood is a food-delivery platform to bridge the gap
                    between people who crave for home food and chefs behind home
                    kitchens with their perfect and delicious dishes. We believe
                    that a woman who can run a family can run a business
                    effortlessly, and now we're taking a step towards giving a
                    push to all those women with a hidden interest in gaining
                    the identity that they deserve.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We understand how tough it is to manage a home along with a
                    business, but we want to do everything we could to make
                    their job easier. For example: If she has school-going kids,
                    she must be busy in the mornings and evenings, then she can
                    just work for 2 hours a day and skip weekends to
                    effortlessly manage family and job. Not only that, you don't
                    personally have to serve the customers or arrange for a
                    home-pickup or home-delivery options. We will provide you
                    with the driver-partners to collect food directly from the
                    kitchen and deliver it at the customer's doorstep. <br />
                    <br />
                    And one more exciting thing is, you don't have to have an
                    entire menu like restaurants. You can cook only a few items
                    that you excel in, even if it's just one dish. And we'll
                    take it out on a tasting-spree. Wait, wait, we're not done
                    yet. We also want you to save more while you earn more. Then
                    women of MothersFood get access to M-food, an online grocery
                    store where they can place the order for groceries for a
                    very better price compared to your local market. How do we
                    do that? We said we'll go up to any mark to make empowerment
                    easier for women, and we mean it. We directly made
                    connections with the brands for a great deal. <br />
                    <br />
                    Every mother is a great chef. But even the greatest chefs
                    have a special dish. Aren't they? We're out looking for
                    those dishes to make them more famous, instead of limiting
                    them to your family. A simple step can empower her with
                    something that she's already excelled in. We'll give the
                    mother the respect and identity that she deserves. Not just
                    in the family, but also in society.
