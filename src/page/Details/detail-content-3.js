              Sure, Fast food can be luring with its looks, aroma, and taste,
              but have you realized the oily platters, unhygienic kitchen
              equipment, and rotten ingredients? Yes. That's what makes them
              tasty, and most important unhealthy. We all have a myth that
              homemade food is not as delicious as street food. Well, whoever
              said that surely didn't understand the homemade food well.
