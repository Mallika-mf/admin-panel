            Food is loved by everyone. But what goes into your body is directly proportional to what shows on your body and health. So in simple words eating healthy is very necessary. Not just that but ingredients are used to make the food you are consuming is also necessary to be checked. With the increasing demand and expensive raw materials, people have forgotten to use authentic ingredients for their food preparations. When you go to someoneâ€™s house people will always serve you home-cooked food the reason being one never uses bad quality products for themselves if they can afford it. One always uses the best quality because it is much better to have a better quality of food than to pay the doctor for medicines and the medical issues caused by that food.
