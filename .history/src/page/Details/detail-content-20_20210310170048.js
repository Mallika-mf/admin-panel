            The sugars of honey are more easily digested than those of table sugar. The dry weight of honey is 95% carbohydrates, which include the sugar molecules fructose and glucose; however, table sugar (refined cane sugar) is solely sucrose. Glucose and fructose are more easily digested than fructose. and they are also chemically different. Sucrose is a complex sugar (a compound of glucose and fructose together), but in order to break down sucrose, acids or enzymes are needed. This is how bees convert the complex sugars of flower nectar into the simple sugars found in honey - they secrete a special enzyme for the process. The end result contains simple sugars that are easily absorbed by body. Because fructose is actually sweeter than sucrose, honey can taste sweeter than ordinary sugar! Honey contains a diverse nutrients array of vitamins, minerals, and other organic compounds.
