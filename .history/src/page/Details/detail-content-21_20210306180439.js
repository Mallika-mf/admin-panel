            Are you exercising every day just to be healthy but still
facing health issues? Are your diets not suiting your
medical conditions and feel like a task? Healthy eating
is also known as clean eating is often misunderstood to
be some kind of a crash diet. Clean eating focuses on
consuming whole foods that are minimally processed
and as close to their natural form as possible.

            Adopting a clean eating plan can be a simple and
effective way to lose weight and boost your overall
health.

            Additionally, eating clean means relying less on
processed, store-bought items and preparing more
meals at home, which could save you money Healthy
eating means cutting out on foods that you consume as
a part of your cravings. It is removing your wants and
sticking to your needs. Many nutritionists suggest that
if one shift to healthier food habits they might never
need to follow any kind of diet again. Maintaining a
healthy diet keeps the immune system balanced and
ready to fight against infection and viruses. It is a
lifestyle change:

            Protein is the building block of immune cells. A diet
lacking in protein can seriously hamper your immune
function. Most adults need at least 50 grams of quality
protein per day, or a palm-sized portion per meal if
that’s easier to visualize. Make an eating pattern out of
incorporating quality protein for each meal, like eggs
for breakfast, chickpea and chapati for lunch, and
chicken salad for dinner.                       <br />

As a rule of thumb, the more colorful foods are, the
healthier they are – unless you’re eating a bag of
Skittles. Deep rich colors indicate micronutrients and
antioxidants, which your body needs for protection
and recovery from illness. Studies have shown that
antioxidants improve immune responses, so throw
some purple cabbage, red bell pepper, and green
beans in your grocery cart, will ya?! And when you get
home, cook them up with lots of herbs or yellow
turmeric for an extra flavor boost            <br />

            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Chickpeas, for example, which is often used in
vegetarian curries, are a great source of fiber, zinc,
folate, and protein, which makes them a healthy factor
in a vegetarian Indian diet. Spinach and tomatoes,
which are widely used in Indian cuisine, are also known
superfoods, containing high levels of antioxidants,
vitamins, and minerals. <br /></p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Likewise, many Indian sauces and accompaniments are
vegetable-based, such as Sag aloo (spinach) and Gobhi
Aloo (cauliflower with potatoes) making them a
healthy choice as the majority do not use cream or
cheese. <br /></p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>The minty yogurt dip raita, made from natural yogurt,
cucumber, and mint, is a source of calcium and is a
low-fat alternative to sauces such as mayonnaise.
Natural yogurt is also often used to form curry sauces
instead of cream or coconut milk. <br /></p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Garlic features greatly in Indian cooking, which is said
to be good for the heart, as do chilies, which are good
for the immune system and metabolism. <br /></p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Indian dishes often use vegetable, sesame, and peanut
oil rather than butter, which keeps them lower in
saturated fat. <br /></p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Finally, as Indian dishes have such an impacting taste
often just a small portion can satisfy taste buds,
helping you to consume fewer calories. An Indian diet’s
variety and vibrancy keep it interesting, which is a
healthy component to any cuisine as the variety can
prevent boredom and overeating. <br /></p>
