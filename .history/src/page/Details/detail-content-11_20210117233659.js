                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Biryani, a dish well known in almost all Indian states and loved by majority of Indian population. Most researchers believe biryani originated from Persian cuisine and was inculcated or brought to the Indian subcontinent by the Mughals. <br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Biryani was then further Indianized- included more flavours and spices from the royal kitchen of the Mughals. There are numerous biryani recipes that are famous and loved by people all over the world. Below are few of the top most biryani recipes.
                    <br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                    One of the most consumed biryani recipes is chicken and mutton biryani. And the best city to eat a flavourful spicy biryani is Hyderabad. Hyderabadi Chicken/ mutton Dum Biryani we can say is world famous. It is full of spices, flavours and is slow cooked and served steaming hot. Chicken biryani making is usually with chicken thigh and breast pieces marinated in Indian spices, cooked and then half cooked rice is added to the gravy and cooked further. Mutton biryani has a longer marination time so that the pieces become softer even before cooking. One of the popular spices used in Hyderabadi biryani is garam masala. Few of the world-famous restaurants in Hyderabad are- Shadab, Shah Ghouse, Bawarchi, Paradise (even celebrities prefer biryani here), Ulvacharu, Pakwaan etc. <br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Then comes Veg biryani. Vegetable biryani is prepared in a similar recipe as chicken or mutton biryani recipe however different types of vegetables are added as substitute to the meat. Veg biryani is quite delicious as well. All the vegetarians out there love veg biryani and enjoy it like no other vegetarian dish. Hyderabad is famous for veg dum biryani recipe as well. <br/>Biryani ingredients used in vegetable biryani are same as chicken biryani recipe or mutton biryani recipe. Again, there are many places all over India where you get delicious veg biryani. Delhi Darbar in Mumbai, Bawarchi in Hyderabad etc.<br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>The next favourite biryani recipe for Indians is paneer biryani. From the name it is clear that paneer biryani is made with paneer. The biriyani cooking process of paneer is similar to chicken and mutton biryani except that there is mostly no marination involved. Vegetarians enjoy paneer biryani as a special on occasions and festivals. Paneer biryani is enjoyed all over india and there are few variations in recipes regionally. Paneer biryani is mostly famous in vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian restaurants.<br/></p>
                   
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Another variant or extended version of paneer biryani is the paneer tikka biryani. Its meaning can be derived from its name itself. Paneer is first made into tandoori paneer tikkas and then added into the biryani preparation process unlike normal paneer biryani where paneer is directly added. Marination of paneer in the tikka masala is the most important step. The ingredients which go into the marination are vey aromatic, make paneer tastier from inside. Curd is the main ingredient as it lets the masalas penetrate deep into paneer.<br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>The next favourite biryani for vegetarians is mushroom biryani. It can be made instantly. It is also called one pot biryani since the whole cooking process can be completed by cooking in just one pot. Most people prefer mushroom biryani as it is loaded with nutrients and anti-oxidants and is very good for improving immunity. The preparation process of mushroom biryani is somewhat similar to egg biryani as there is no marination involved. Mushrooms are first stir fried and partially cooked in a gravy full of masalas, herbs and spices and then par boiled rice is added to the gravy and cooked in the same pot. Many vegetarians enjoy mushroom biryani.<br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>For all the eggetarians out there, their king of biryani recipes is egg biryani. It is also called ande ki biryani. Egg biryani recipe is made with boiled eggs. It is similar to chicken biriyani making; however, the only difference is that boiled eggs are fried in oil first. And then biriyani ingredients and the recipe are followed same as mutton biryani recipe or any other dum biryani recipe.<br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Fish biryani is next on the list. Fish biryani recipe is comparatively more famous in the coast lines of India. Especially Malabar fish biryani is the most loved in the coastal states of India. Again, fish biryani recipe is prepared with different types os fish; boneless and with bone. Biryani ingredients used for making fish biryani are the same however the steps in biryani making differ. Fish is first marinated and then fried in oil until its cooked 50% and then the same biryani making is followed; cooking the rice, cooking gravy and then adding the fish and then the gravy with fish is cooked along with rice and served hot.<br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Another variety of sea food biryani is prawn biryani also known as shrimp biryani. This has many regional favourite recipes and is most consumed in the coastal states. It is again an aromatic biryani making process prepared by cooking shrimp, basmati rice, herbs, spices and other biryani ingredients. Prawns biryani has rather a different taste when compared to chicken biryani or mutton biryani. It is because of the taste to the shrimp meat. Prawns biryani is cooked using the best quality rice and like any other biriyani making process, layering process is used where in a layer of rice and a layer of gravy of prawns is cooked. In few Malabar coast areas, it is also called chemmeen biryani<br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>A very popular biryani in the recent times is donne biryani. Donne biryani is a famous biryani originated in Bangalore, Karnataka. Donne means a cup made out a leaf, preferably nut palm leaf.  So donne biryani is a biryani which is served in a big cup made out of a leaf. The preparation process of donne biryani is similar to pulao as the cooking involves cooking with chicken/mutton stock. It is not like the traditional mutton or chicken biryani where rice and meat are layered and cooked. Rather it is cooked with stock and hence the whole rice is lot more flavourful. <br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Chicken 65 biryani, boneless biryani is different from dum biryani. In chicken 65 biryani or boneless biryani, chicken is first cooked or fried and then added to the flavoured rice. But in the traditional chicken dum biryani and mutton dum biryani, meat and rice are cooked with aromatic herbs and spices in the dum method. Which is using a dough or a muslin cloth to seal the vessel and let the meat and rice cook in the heat and steam.<br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Another popular variant of biryani is the beef biryani. Beef biryani is again a flavourful rice-based dish cooked along with biryani ingredients, spices, herbs and beef. Beef biryani is also known as Kalyani biryani. Beef biryani is a cheaper version of the chicken or mutton biryani available out there as the meat is comparatively cheaper than mutton or chicken. The preparation process of beef biryani is similar to any popular dum biryani recipes. Beef biryani has a lot of demand in Hyderabad and we can say that all over India, beef biryani is highly consumed and has high demand in Hyderabad.<br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Soya is a bean derived from a plant in the Asian region and is highly used to replace animal meat because of the similarities in taste and nutritional value. It is high in protein content. Hence Soya Biryani is equally famous among people who do not eat animal products. Soya chunks have protein content higher than milk, eggs. Soya is also called meal maker and hence the biryani is also known as meal maker biryani. It is a very high protein dish served just by itself or with a side of raitha and onions, adding a masala gravy is optional. Soya biryani is usually cooked in a pressure cooker unlike the traditional biryani making process. Soya chunks are first boiled and then added to the gravy with masala and lastly rice is added and then it is pressure cooked and served hot.<br/></p>

Dindigul Thalapakattu is the name of the restaurant which serves Thalapakattu biryani, started in the year 1957 by Nagasamy Naidu. Nagasamy Naidu wore a turban and hence the biryani gets its name from there. The distinctive flavour of this biryani comes mainly from Seeraga Samba rice, similar to Jeerakashala or Kaima rice used in Malabar Biryani. It is cooked in a pressure cooker.<br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Next famous biryani is the matka biryani. It is completely similar to the Hyderabadi dum biryani. However, the only major difference is that it is cooked in an earthenware pot. Matka means pot in Hindi hence the name of the biryani. The complete preparation process, ingredients used in biryani making is the same. The taste of matka biryani is amazing as well. It has the flavour of earthenware pot which makes it different form the regular biryanis.<br/></p>

Kadai biryani is prepared in a wok, hence the name. Again, the process is similar Hyderabadi chicken biryani recipe except that it is made in a wok and prepared really with slow cooking as it is cooked in the wok. Biryani masala ingredients and everything remains the same except the vessel in which biryani is prepared. Kadai biryani is mostly famous in the southern parts on India.<br/></p>
                    <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Next famous biryani is aloo biryani. Aloo biryani is made with baby potatoes in most biryani making processes. Regular potatoes can also be used. Potatoes can be deep fried and sued or else boiled and used. Aloo biryani is one of vegetarians’ regular favourites, but usually people prefer to mix all veggies and cook instead of just aloo. The spicy feel of this biryani would differ with regions and demography.<br/></p>

Kolkata biryani now is gaining momentum and flourishing in the recent past giving a strong competition to Hyderabadi biryani. It is a modified version of or inspired version of Lucknow biryani. Lucknow and Kolkata biryani focus more on the meat flavours in the spices and rice unlike Hyderabad biryani which focuses on spices, masalas and then meat. Compared to Lucknow biryani, Kolkata biryani’s meat to rice ratio is lesser. And potatoes were added instead of meat for the vegetarian version.<br/></p>
